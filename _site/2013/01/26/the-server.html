			<p>So, let&#8217;s take a look at what I&#8217;ve done so far.</p>

<h2 id='the_server'>The server</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been with MediaTemple for many years, first with their (dv) servers for client work, then their (gs) servers for my personal sites. I&#8217;ve never had a problem with them in all that time. Their customer service is impeccable, their knowledgebase is a treasure trove of information, and the user forums pointed me in the right direction more times than I care to count. So, even though the price was a little higher than probably warranted, I opted for their (ve) server. What you get is 4+ GB of RAM, 20+ GB of HDD space, and, well, that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t even know how much processing power I&#8217;ve got. You choose from 4 different Linux variations, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS and Debian, if I recall correctly. Then you get SSH access, and away you go! Anything you want on there, that&#8217;s up to you.</p>

<p>Oh, but why, Graham, WHY!? I hear you ask. Well firstly, stop shouting. Secondly, because I like to experiment. Even at the server level. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;d dare do for a client, however, but on a shared host you wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to dabble in things like NodeJS or set up your own Git server.</p>

<h2 id='the_setup'>The setup</h2>

<p>With a (ve) server humming along nicely, I installed Fedora 15 through MT&#8217;s admin panel then followed one of their articles on securing the system by removing root access. I chose Fedora as I&#8217;m just comfortable with it; Fedora 3 was my first experience with Linux. Given how I went about things, what you read here will apply to any Linux install.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to think that just because I&#8217;ve gone to a <em>hosting</em> company that I&#8217;ve rented a Web server. But, well, at the moment it&#8217;s just a Linux box, I could do anything I liked with it. Minecraft server, anyone? Or how about a Teamspeak/Ventrilo server for you World of Warcrafters out there.</p>

<p>These options are always open to me, but I&#8217;m sticking with a Web server for now. Which means I&#8217;ll need some web serving software. The most common is Apache. But, not this time. I&#8217;m going for something smaller, leaner, faster. I&#8217;m going for nginx. I want my Web server spitting out static files as fast as it can, and nginx does this superbly. Later, if I want Apache serving up PHP files or whatever, then I can use nginx as a proxy, directing all calls to PHP files off to Apache, but leave it serving up the static files.</p>

<p>Linux distributions tend to have a package management system. Ubuntu/Debian has apt, Fedora and Red Hat based systems have rpm/yum, whichever you use, you&#8217;ll often find that the package available through these means is an older version. So, it&#8217;s up to you to decide how old you&#8217;re comfortable with. This server is a testing ground for me. I like to live on the cutting edge, so tend to go for the latest development version. Not Nightlies though. That&#8217;s just silly. In the case of nginx the latest <em>stable</em> version was 1.2.x and the latest development version was 1.3.x, but the latest package was 1.0.x. That&#8217;s just too far back really. So, the only option is to grab the latest files and compile it myself, which, in the Linux world is almost as simple as installing the package.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s how we do it. Firstly, SSH into your server with</p>

<pre><code>ssh domainname.com</code></pre>

<p>Then we&#8217;re going to use a common place to hold the source files and download what we need. If you didn&#8217;t log in as root, then you&#8217;ll need to run sudo -i so all the commands are run as root. Otherwise you&#8217;ll have permission errors coming out your ears.</p>

<pre><code>cd /usr/local/src
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.3.11.tar.gz
tar xzvf nginx-1.3.11.tar.gz
cd nginx-1.3.11
./configure</code></pre>

<p>Wait for the configuration to complete. Now, if you hit a problem where after configure it says:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;./configure: error: the HTTP rewrite module requires the PCRE library. You can either disable the module by using --without-http_rewrite_module option, or install the PCRE library into the system, or build the PCRE library statically from the source with nginx by using --with-pcre=&lt;path&gt; option.&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Or the same with the zlib library, which is what happened to me, then you&#8217;ll need to download those two libraries to your server, unzip them and include them during the configuration. So, still in the /usr/local/src directory grab the two libraries:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pcre/pcre/8.32/pcre-8.32.tar.gz
wget http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.7.tar.gz

tar xzvf pcre-8.32.tar.gz
tar xzvf zlib-1.2.7.tar.gz</code></pre>

<p>It isn&#8217;t a direct link to the PCRE library, so it might take a few attempts to get the files. If you&#8217;re having issues, then you can use the link to download the files locally, then using your SSH details, SFTP into your server and upload it manually. This <em>could</em> cause issues if you disabled root access as I did. The you&#8217;d have to upload the files to your home directory and move them through the command line. I can help with that outside of the article if requested.</p>

<p>With those downloaded, head back to your nginx folder and alter the configuration line, like so</p>

<pre><code>cd /usr/local/src/nginx-1.3.11
./configure --with-pcre=../pcre-8.32 --with-zlib=../zlib-1.2.7</code></pre>

<p>And that should sort it out.</p>

<p>Now run the following two commands</p>

<pre><code>make
make install</code></pre>

<p>And you&#8217;re almost set! Now we need to configure and start the server. Setting up nginx isn&#8217;t trivial, unfortunately, but thankfully the HTML5 Boilerplate guys have come to the rescue with their <a href='https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs'>server configs</a>. With nginx everything is set in one config file, but has the option to include files, a bit like PHP&#8217;s include(). I actually prefer it now, having spent a bit of time with it. Feels a bit more like JSON than some horrid XML love-child. For each domain you want to serve you add a server {} block. Simple.</p>

<p>H5BP takes a nice approach by setting up the conf file to look for separate domain-specific configuration files. Then each time you add a new domain, you just add a new file to a folder instead of editing the main conf file.</p>

<p>Compiling nginx yourself puts the files into <code>/usr/local/nginx</code> and the conf files are in <code>/usr/local/nginx/conf/</code></p>

<p>If you log into your server via SFTP as root, this&#8217;ll be much easier. Head to <code>/usr/local/nginx/conf</code> then replace the mime.types and nginx.conf file with the H5BP versions, copy in the H5BP conf folder and the sites-available. I don&#8217;t think we need the sites-enabled folder, tbh. I tweaked the H5BP conf file to the following, which should suit you well into the thousands of page views.</p>

<pre><code># As a thumb rule: One per CPU. If you are serving a large amount
# of static files, which requires blocking disk reads, you may want
# to increase this from the number of cpu_cores available on your
