title: The Level Editor
---

Features our level editor should support:

- Multiple levels or rooms. In our case, the main level will be the overworld, but then we have sub-levels for each of the dungeons.
- Layers
- Default layers for required game-related systems, such as objects, entities and collisions
- Asset viewer/explorer
- Load and save
