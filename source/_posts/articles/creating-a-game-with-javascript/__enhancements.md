Shadows:

SNES Zelda had shadows (but they didnâ€™t affect entities). They all pointed north/upwards as if the sun was shining from the bottom of the screen. These shadows, mostly around walls, increased in depth depending on the height of the wall. Now, I am aware of a technique to create these shadows dynamically which I would think requires the shadow casting tile to have transparency, or since these shadows only ever appear on flat grass or dirt, we could have pre-drawn images for shadow tiles.
