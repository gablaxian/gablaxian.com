__UPDATE__

Following on from the post below, wherein I posed what sort of game people would like to see made, frankly, no one gave a shit. As expected from people living in the internet. So my fallback option, re-creating The Legend of Zelda but with SNES graphics, is a go!

## Introduction

Oh, hi. I didn’t see you there. When did you get here? WHO ARE YOU!? Erm... I mean, welcome! I’m delighted to announce my little side-project, Super JS Adventure! In an effort to improve my own Javascript skills, along with my love of computer games, what will follow is my journey into writing a (hopefully) simple JS game over the course of several weeks/months(years?). The plan is to blog the journey, step-by-step, starting from basic concepts such as the game loop, leading up to less concrete concepts like level design.

I’ve been wrestling with the idea of what to build. Initially it was to be a generic platformer. Something that would feature all aspects of game design. But, having been playing the original Legend of Zelda on the NES recently–not having had access to it as a child, but instead, the musically creepy Zelda II–and wondering what it would look like with the SNES’s Zelda: A Link to the Past graphics, I thought we could build that instead.

I leave this decision to you, dear anonymous internet folk. Either watch, comment and learn, as we reconstruct a classic, or crowd source the whole process and create something entirely new. However, bare in mind the following: I am not a designer. Reconstructing a classic has the added bonus that all the assets I would need are available online. Whereas, creating something from scratch would require art assets that would be beyond my abilities. This would lead to either the most horrendous graphics known to man, or you’d have to help me out in making them.

Whichever route we take, all the code will be [available on Github](http://github.com/gablaxian/super-js-adventure) for you to peruse, or even use for some dastardly purpose. All decisions will be explained, and iterated upon as the project grows. This will be very much a brute force approach to game development. All part of the learning/teaching process.
