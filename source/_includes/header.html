        Hey there! I thought I’d be all super geek-trendy and put some comments here in the header. Then I can be all like,"Oh, Hey! You must be a developer because you’re looking at my source code", and you’re all, like, "Whaaaaaat! I'm *totally* a developer! He *gets* me! WE ARE SO ALIKE".

        Aaaah, we have fun don’t we.

        Basically, it took me ages to design this grotesque, sorry excuse for a website. I built it on Jekyll, and I kind of wish I hadn’t, but I’ve recently learnt the power of permalinks, so it’s growing on me. And at least the site is fast. Like, REDONKULOUSLY fast. So there’s that.
