        Hey there! I thought I'd be all super geek-trendy and put some comments here in the header. Then I can be all like,"Hey, you must be a developer because you're looking at my source code", and you're all, like, "Whaaaaaat! I'm *totally* a developer. He *gets* me! WE ARE SO ALIKE".

        Aaaah, we have fun don't we.

        Basically, it took me ages to design this grotesque, sorry excuse for a website. I built it on Jekyll, and I kind of wish I hadn't because I think if you're not *just* blogging, it really slows you down. But, the site is redonkulously fast. Like, REDONKULOUSLY fast. So there's that.
